Design a car, how should we design it ?

what should be final ? What should be static ?


Final: 
VIN
production date/Date of manufacture

Static:
members belong to class not instance

Java always passes by value
1, for primitive, copy of the value itself
2, for object, copy of the reference

Array
1, Arrays are Objects.
2, length if a field of the array object
3, array length cannot be changed after the array object is created. (final)
