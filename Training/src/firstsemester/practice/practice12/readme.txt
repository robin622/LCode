Review and Something about DFS

Stack class is not used ?
1, From semantic perspective, it implements List, which is not clear. 
2, From implementation perspective, it is thread safe so it is not efficient enough. 

Any class implements iterable can use for each loop. 

why interface oriented coding ?
1, flexible
2, extensible

Subset
1， 每一层代表一个位置
2， 每一层代表一个字母

DFS
1, assume subproblem has been resolved. 
2, DFS recursion tree is in your mind. 

String, Integer, Double ... are immutable !!!
