Most significant bit (the leftmost bit)

There is no unsigned type in Java

postive's complement + 1 is negative

反码 : ones' complement
补码 : two's complement

对于正数, 反码和补码不变.
对于负数, 反码就是整数取反,补码就是反码加一. 

4 digits: 
              min         max        count
ori          -7(1111)    7(0111)      15
ones' com    -7(1000)    7(0111)      15 
two's com    -8(1000)    7(0111)      16

>> arithmetical shift
>>> logical shift

>> 约等于 /2, 但是得考虑奇偶性!!!
for example, -7 >> 2 is -4
如果负数 >> 会有问题!!!

tenary operator 
三目运算符

why we need wrapper class ?
primitive can not express "does not exist"
wrapper classes has extra overhead

autoboxing
unboxing

if Integer ><= primitive, value will be compared. 

+, -, *, /, >, <, >=, <= only applied to primitive type

no autoboxing or unboxing between int[] and Integer[]. 

when substring, is offset and count fields changed or new a string ?
before java 7u6, it is reused. 
after java 7u6, it is newly created.
