class 18 Nested Class, Iterators, Generics, Enum

1, It is a way of logically grouping classes that are only used in one place. 
2, It increases encapsulation
3, It can lead to more readable and maintainable code. 

prefer static nested class to inner class

because inner class has the reference to outer class which may lead to memory issue. 

Only one top-level class can be declared public in a java file. 

Top level class can only be "public/default". 

Top level class or nested class
1, A nested class has access to private members of the outer class but helper class does not. 
2, You may want your helper class to help multiple classes in the same package. 
3, A static nested class can be declared public but not for helper class. 
4, By design: Nesting a class sends a clear message of intent: the nested class. A Helper is only relevant and usable
to support A class. It has no meaning on its own. 

when to use nested, individual and non-top class.  
if class needs to access top level class's members and methods, use nested class. 
if class needs to be accessed by out of package, use individual class. 
if class only be accessed by top class and no need to access top class's members, define in same class file. 

Iterator
next()
hasNext()

ListIterator
Only for List

Generics
during compile time, check type error. 

Enum

有一个class, 有多个field, 存放各种score, 比如有math, english, physics等, 然后要设计的api的input是一个list of属于这个class的object, 
还有一个input is一个string, 这个string可能是math, english或physics, 然后api要实现的是根据input string的这个field找出前十个最大的返回,
怎么样才可以一遍priority queue代码就能实现,而不是同样priority queue代码写三遍.
