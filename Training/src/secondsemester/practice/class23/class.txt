class 21: C++ vs Java (vs. Python), Garbage collection

why Java ?



CPP --> Compile (windows compiler) --> 1
   \
    \
  \   Compile (linux compiler) --> 2
   \   
    \  
     Compile (apple compiler) --> 3
      

compiling execution multi-platform
interpret execution user friendly

young generation scan - minor GC
old generation scan - major GC
Permanent generation (class, method, string intern pool) - full GC

From Java 8, permanent generation is moved out of Heap. 

How to know which one is a garbage ?

1, Local variable on Stack is not garbage. They are GC roots.
2, each thead is also a GC root. 
3, static variable is GC root. 
4, JNI reference are GC roots.
