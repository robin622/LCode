class 10 Bit representation and Bit Operations

& : 按位与
&& : 逻辑与

<< (>>)
left or right shift, the number does not get changed. For example, b = (a >> 2), a does not change. 

>> left fills notation marks. 
<< right fills zero
>>> make sure left fills zero

X & (1 << K) result is not 0 or 1. You need to compare it with 0. 

int 32 bits
long 64 bits
byte 8 bits
char and short 16 bits
short (signed)
char (unsigned)

toCharArray : time complexity is O(n) , Space Complexity is O(n).
