1, when swap-swap can be applied ?

all letters in the input should be included in the result. 

2, permutation, combination and subset why DFS not BFS ?
From space complexity perspective, DFS is O(height), but for BFS, O(n) because it will save all generated nodes. It is 
too many. 

DFS
1, print all subsets of a set
2, print all valid permutation of () () ()
3, 99 cents
4, swap-swap

Depth First Search vs Recursion vs Back-tracking

DFS is a kind of search algorithm
Recursion is a kind of implementation

DFS can be implemented with Recursion

DFS = Back-tracking
Back-tracking is a behavior of DFS.

1, how many levels in the recursion tree ? what does it store on each level ?
2, how many different states should we try to put on each level ? (how many branches ?)

DFS after based case, return is needed.
