Yahoo Question
Round 1
1.1 What is working behind when you enter "yahoo.com" in browser ?
(1) Browser will check the cache to see if there is a correspondent IP. (it can check browser cache
operating system cache, router cache and ISP cache). 
(1.1) if IP can not be found, ISP' DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of server
that hosts "yahoo.com". 
(2) With the IP, browser initiates a TCP connection with the server. (this connection is established using
a process called the TCP/IP three-way handshake: client sends a SYN, server responses SYN/ACK, client
responses ACK. )
(3) Then, browser sends an HTTP request (POST/GET) to the web server.  
(4) The server handles the request and send back a response. 
(5) The browser displays the content.

1.2 When database query is slow, what do you think has problem ?


1.3 2-Sum(follow up: 1TB vs 32 GB memory with a laptop)

1.4 OO design a coffee machine. 

Round 2 
2.1 BST delete a node with key=x
2.2 Give two sorted arrays a[] and b[]. Say each entry is sum of a[i]+b[j]. Find the first K sums in ascending order
2.3 LRU cache

Round 3 
3.1 Java questions: what is final, finally, finalize ?
3.2 What is stingbuffer, stringbuilder ?
3.3 How is java's hashmap implemented ?
3.4 What is linkedHashMap ? (insertion order or access order) LRU (least recent used)

3.5 Find first non duplicate character in a string, do it in one pass. 

Round 4 
4.1 What is ploymorphism with example (function overload vs override) ?
4.2 Binary search in two sorted arrays to find a target (Follow up, what if k arrays)
4.3 OO design a file system


1, Array
2, Stack
3, Queue
4, LinkedList

1 to 4 is liner data structure

5, Tree
6, Heap
7, Graph
8, Hash table

knowledges

Binary Search
Partition
Sorting Algorithm
SubSet
Deduplication
Longest subarray/sequence
Common Sequeuce
Sliding Window
Re-ordering
Compression
Geometry

Good or not?
1, time complexity and space complexity 
2, O(n) = worst case (asymptotic upper bound), amortized time
Theta(n) = tight bound (asymptotic bound from above and below)
Omega(n) = best case (asymptotic lower bound)

Space complexity: is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm

Binary Search
Common assumption: Array has to be sorted ascending or descending. (is this necessary?)

Principle of Binary Search
1, We must guarantee that the search space decreases over time(after each iteration).
2, We must guarantee that the target (if exists) can not be ruled out accidently, when we change
the value of Left or Right. (It is critical to define the rule about how to move the range of search)

Q1 -- classic BST
Q2 -- 2D BST
Q3 -- closest target
Q4 -- first target
Q5 -- last target

Q1 - Q5 easy

Mediate:
Q6 -- getCloestKTarget
Q7 -- smallest element that is larger than Target

Hard:
Q8 -- K-th Smallest in Two Sorted Array
Q9 -- K-th Cloest Element
Q10 -- Binary Search with Unknown Size
Q11 -- 
Q12 -- 

BinarySearch 搜索空间折半查找!!!

My summary
1, search space decreases each round (focus on impossible half)
2, target should not be ruled out
3, one element to test if code can get into while loop
4, two elements to make sure no dead loop in the while. (because (0+1)/2 = 0, mid can only equal to left)

Difference between >> and >>>
>> arithmetic shift right
>>> logical shift right : without considering the positive or negative sign
