Binary Tree II 

BST left < middle < right
HEAP (max heap) top level > second top level > third top level

Heap after remove, adjust
BST  find a specific node and no adjust

Google implements a iterator to traverse with post order traversal

Amazon k closet in BST

Why iteration for traversing tree ?
1, Move out the space consumption of STACK to HEAP. 
2, Implement iterator(next(), hasNext()).
