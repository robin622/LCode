Stack LIFO
call stack is a stack data structure stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. 

where are primitive types saved ?
*** it can be saved to both stack and heap. *** 
*** reference can also be saved in both stack and heap. ***

where to save depends on the role it plays
if it is a state in class, it is saved in Heap. 
if it is a local variable in method, it is saved in stack. 

Default value: zero, false, null

Only field has default value. Local value does not have default values.
